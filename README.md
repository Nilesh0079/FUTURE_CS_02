# Password Strength Analyzer

This Python project provides a simple GUI-based password strength analyzer.  It evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria, calculates its entropy, and displays the results along with feedback on how to improve the password.  It also shows a truncated SHA-256 hash of the password (for demonstration only; the application does *not* store passwords).

## Features

* **Password Strength Evaluation:** Checks for minimum length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* **Entropy Calculation:** Estimates the password's entropy in bits, providing a measure of its randomness.
* **Strength Rating:** Assigns a qualitative strength rating (Very Strong, Strong, Moderate, Weak, Very Weak).
* **Feedback:** Offers specific suggestions for improving the password's strength.
* **SHA-256 Hashing (Demonstration):** Displays a truncated SHA-256 hash of the entered password.  **Note:** This is for demonstration purposes only.  The application does not store the password or its hash.
* **Simple GUI:** Uses Tkinter for a basic and easy-to-use interface.
